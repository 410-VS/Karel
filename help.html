Intro</p>    <p></p>    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">A. What is Karel?<br />      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Karel is a game, setup as an interface        between the user and a robot. The robot, Karel, lives in a map filled        with gems. The user's job is to get Karel safely around the map without        hitting any walls while picking up gems and eventually returning  home.        As the user progresses through difficulty levels, they are presented        with new ways to control Karel. The first is simple buttons: turn        left/right, pick up a gem, go, etc. The second has the user typing these        commands, one command per line. The third allows the user an even more        complex method of control, such instructing the robot to repeat a series        of commands or even find out things about the world around him on his        own.</div>      <br />      B. Why are you using Karel?<br />      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">As the user progresses through difficulty        levels, they begin to encounter basic methods of programming. For        example, a program could be written that carefully steps through a        problem one computation at a time, as in the second level of Karel's        difficulty. The third level, however, allows the user (the programmer)        to let Karel (the program) to ask itself questions about the        computations that need to be done. In this way, Karel is an excellent        opportunity for new  programmers to be exposed to methodology in a        comfortable, non threatening, game like manner.</div>    </div>    <p><br />    </p>    <p>II. The Actors</p>    <p></p>    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">A. Karel<br />      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Karel is the main character of this        excerice.  You will control Karel in a variety of ways, but his main        abilities are to turn right and left, to move forward one space, to pick        up a gem, and to put down a gem.</div>      <br />      B. Walls<br />      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Walls are squares on the map that Karel        can not move onto.  If you walk into a wall, Karel will crash! (not        fully operational at this build)</div>      <br />      C. Gems<br />      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Gems are objects on squares of the map        (gems can not exist on walls, of course).  It is Karel's job to move        around the map and pick these gems up.  He can only pick up a gem if he        is standing directly on top of it.  More than one gem can exist on a        tyle, so be sure to note how many gems are on a square at a time, and        take that into consideration when controlling Karel's actions.</div>      <br />      D. Home Square<br />      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">The home square is essentially the game        ender for Karel.  Once you have collected all gems from the map, Karel        must go to his home and drop all of his gems onto the home square.  This        will always be Karel's winning condition, no matter what the map is        like.</div>    </div>    <p><br />    </p>    <p>III. Button Mode<br />    </p>    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">A. Controlling with Buttons<br />      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">The introductory level of the game will        allow you to control Karel by clicking on a single button for each        individual action.  These buttons are as follows:  Go  Left  Right  Get         Put.  The Go button, when clicked, will move Karel one space forward on        the map, in whatever direction he is currently facing.  The Left button        will turn Karel 90 degrees to the left (anti clockwise).  The Right        button will turn Karel 90 degrees to the right (clockwise).  The Get        button will pick up a single gem (remember, multiple gems can exist on        one space!).  The Put button will put down a single gem (again, remember        that multiple gems can exist on one space, so if you put a gem down on a        gem there will be 2 gems on that square).</div>      <br />      B. Enabling Button Mode<br />      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">The game will load with Button Mode turned        on.  If you are no longer in Button Mode (we'll get to that soon), you        can click on the Button Mode in the main window and it will close all        windows not related to Button Mode.  You may want to save your work in        windows not related to Button Mode before pushing this button.</div>      <br />      C. Why Button Mode?<br />      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Familiarizing yourself with the controls        (buttons) in Button Mode is an important first step.  Each button is        tied to a single action available to Karel.  In other modes of the game,        you will use these same commands in the same way you have been using        them in Button Mode, so make sure you understand what they do and        remember how the buttons are labeled.</div>    </div>    <p><br />    </p>    <p>IV. Programmer Mode<br />    </p>    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">A. Turning on Programmer Mode<br />      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">In order to enable Programmer Mode, click        on the button labeled Programmer Mode in the main window of Karel.  This        will open a text editor that you can write commands.</div>      <br />      B. Using Programmer Mode's Text Editor.<br />      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">You can write text in this window and then        have Karel execute the commands represented by the text you have        written.  In order to execute these commands, click on the File menu at        the top left of the editor, then select Run.  The program will then run        through all of the commands in the editor.  If any of these commands        contain inappropriate syntax, you will be alerted of the fact and will        also be told where your error is.  You can also save what you have        written in this editor.  Click File and then choose either Auto Save or        Save As, in order to do so.  The Auto Save option will automatically        generate a file name for your saved file.  This file will be stored in        the same place as the Karel program is stored, and the file name will be        titled using the following format: KarelCode_&lt;numerical        day&gt;_&lt;name of the month&gt;_&lt;numerical hour&gt;_&lt;numerical        minutes&gt;_&lt;numerical seconds&gt;.txt.  Alternatively, you can        select the Save As.  This will open a file explorer that will let you        specify where in your file system to save the file, as well as what to        name the file.  No matter what name you choose, this will save as a .txt        extension.</div>      <br />      C. Now, Onto The Programming - Single Line Commands<br />      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">To start, you can write the same commands        that you clicked on earlier.  Simply type "go", "left", "right", "get",        "put" and Karel will behave exactly as if you had clicked these buttons        one at a time.  In this way, you can write a series of commands and then        select Run from the File menu, rather than manually clicking the button        for every command.</div>      <br />      D. True or False?<br />      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">One new option available in Programmer        Mode is essentially a truth checker.  This will allow you to check the        truth of a statement before trying to commit unnecessary commands.         Truth checking can be used to find out if you are standing on a gem,        staring at a wall directly ahead of you, or standing on the home        square.  These commands can also be written to check if these things are        not true.  To check the truth of a statement before executing commands,        type: if &lt;wall, gem, home&gt;, then hit enter, then TAB once, then        enter your commands, one line at a time.  You can also add the word        "not" to these commands.  Two examples follow:<br />        <br />        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">if wall<br />              left<br />          <br />          If you are on this step of the commands you have written and Karel is          facing a wall, he will turn left.  Otherwise, Karel will skip this          turn left command.<br />          <br />          if not wall<br />              go</div>        <br />        If you are on this step of the commands you have written, and Karel is        NOT facing a wall, he will go forward once.  If, on the other hand,        Karel is facing a wall, he will skip this go command.</div>      <br />      E. Programming With Loops<br />      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">It's also important to understand that        Programmer Mode also allows loop structures.  The simplest form of a        loop simply repeats a given set of commands a set number of times.  To        do this, you would type: repeat &lt;a number&gt;, then hit enter for a        new line, then hit TAB once, and then type commands just like you did        before.  For example, typing:<br />        <br />        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">repeat 3<br />              go<br />              left</div>        <br />        is exactly like typing:<br />        <br />        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">go<br />          left<br />          go<br />          left<br />          go<br />          left</div>      </div>      <br />      F. Truth Checking With Loops<br />      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">There is also a special option to        simultaneously run a loop with an evaulation of whether or not something        is true.  This is called a while loop.  Essentially, you are telling        Karel to run a series of commands over and over while a given statement        is true.  Karel will enter a while loop if the condition to enter is        true.  Karel will then execute all commands inside the while loop once.         Karel will then go back to the top of the while loop and re-check to see        if the condition to run is still true.  If it is true, Karel will run        the command sequence again.  If it is not true, Karel will move past the        while loop's commands.  An example may here be helpful:<br />        <br />        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">while not wall<br />              go</div>        <br />        This will move Karel one space forward at a time, until he is standing        in front of a wall.</div>      <br />      G. Combining All Of The Above<br />      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">You can use as many while, repeats, and        ifs as you want a time.  This is called nesting.  To do this, you will        have to remember how many of these specific structures you're using at a        time, and maintain the appropriate number of TABs to differentiate        between which lines of commands are associated with which structures.         Again, an example may be worthwhile here:<br />        <br />        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">          while not wall<br />              go<br />              if wall<br />                  left</div>        <br />        The above series of commands will execute if Karel is not facing a        wall.  Then, Karel will move forward one space.  Then, if Karel is        facing a wall, he will turn left (anti clockwise).  Then, the loop will        start back over.  If Karel is still facing a wall (a different wall, of        course) even after turning left, the while loop will stop running.  If,        however, Karel is no longer facing a wall, the while loop will continue        running as before.</div>      <br />      H. A Word of Caution<br />      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">It is entirely possible to write a        sequence of commands that will never, ever stop running.  These are        called infinite loops.  A short example of an infinite loop is as such:<br />        <br />        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">          while not wall<br />              go<br />              while wall<br />                  left</div>        <br />        This sequence of commands will send Karel ahead one space.  Then, it        will check if Karel is facing a new wall.  If he is, Karel will turn        left until he is no longer facing a wall.  Then, the loop is over and        will restart from the top.  Because the "while wall -&gt; left" sequence        forced Karel to turn around until he was no longer facing a wall, the        "while not wall" question will always be true.  That is, Karel will        never be facing a wall if he enters this loop.  Thus, Karel will simply        walk around this map forever, never stopping.  It is up to you, as        Karel's controller, to help him avoid infinite loops.  Fortunately, we        have given you a Stop Button to allow you to break Karel out of his        Sisyphean toils, should he accidentally enter an infinite loop.</div>    </div>    <p><br />    </p>    <p>V. The Interface<br />    </p>    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Most of the interface commands have been      discussed at this point, such as the Run, Auto Save, and Save As options      in Programmer Mode and the Button Mode/Programmer Mode buttons in the main      window.  Additionally, you can click on the File menu in the main Karel      window and select New Map From File.  This will reload the game with a new      map of your specification (discussed later in this document) after      allowing you to choose the map from a file explorer window.  Additional      interface options include the Help menu.  Of course, if you're reading      this, you've already figured out how to use the Help menu.  Finally, two      counters exist on the far right/top corner of the main Karel window.       These are labeled Gem:___ and Moves:___.  The gem counter will display the      number of gems that Karel is currently holding.  The move counter will      display the number of moves that Karel has made since starting the game      (both in Button and Programmer Mode).</div>    <p><br />    </p>    <p>VI. Creating Maps <br />    </p>    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Maps must be a consistent size: 19 spaces      across and 14 down.  The map must be surrounded entirely by a wall.  Aside      from that, the only rules are that there must be at least one gem, only      one Karel, and only one home square.  The appropriate legend for writing      new maps is:<br />      <br />      # - Wall<br />      ^ - Karel<br />      @ - Home Square<br />      $ - Gem<br />      <br />      The default map is thus depicted as:<br />      <br />      <span style="font-family: monospace;">###################</span><br style="font-family: monospace;" />      <span style="font-family: monospace;">#                 #</span><br style="font-family: monospace;" />      <span style="font-family: monospace;">#                 #</span><br style="font-family: monospace;" />      <span style="font-family: monospace;">#                 #</span><br style="font-family: monospace;" />      <span style="font-family: monospace;">#                 #</span><br style="font-family: monospace;" />      <span style="font-family: monospace;">#                 #</span><br style="font-family: monospace;" />      <span style="font-family: monospace;">#        $        #</span><br style="font-family: monospace;" />      <span style="font-family: monospace;">#       $#$       #</span><br style="font-family: monospace;" />      <span style="font-family: monospace;">#      $###$      #</span><br style="font-family: monospace;" />      <span style="font-family: monospace;">#     $#####$     #</span><br style="font-family: monospace;" />      <span style="font-family: monospace;">#    $#######$    #</span><br style="font-family: monospace;" />      <span style="font-family: monospace;">#   $#########$   #</span><br style="font-family: monospace;" />      <span style="font-family: monospace;"># ^ ###########  @#</span><br style="font-family: monospace;" />      <span style="font-family: monospace;">###################</span><br />      <br />      Once you've written a new map, you can click on the File menu in the main      Karel window and select New Map from File.  This will open a file explorer      that will allow you to locate and select a written map for the game to      load.  Once loaded, the game will reset the display to the new map.<br />      <br />    </div>    <p><br />      VII. Some Closing Words</p>    <p></p>    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">We hope you have enjoyed learning with us.       While there is some functionality left to be implemented and perfected, we      believe that this game should provide a valuable learning experience to      new programmers.<br />    </div>    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Happy Coding!<br />    </h2>  </body></html>
